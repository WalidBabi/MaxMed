# Supplier Onboarding Review Feature

## Overview
After a supplier completes their onboarding process, they now see a clear message that MaxMed will review their profile before they can start adding products and receiving inquiries/orders.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Onboarding Completion Flow
- When a supplier completes the final step (category selection), their profile status is set to `pending_approval`
- They are redirected to the dashboard with a success message explaining the review process
- The success message now reads: "Onboarding completed successfully! MaxMed will review your profile and category assignments. Once approved, you can add products to your categories and start receiving inquiries and orders."

### 2. Dashboard Pending Approval State
- The supplier dashboard now detects when a supplier has completed onboarding but is still pending approval
- A prominent yellow warning message is displayed at the top of the dashboard
- The message explains:
  - That their profile is under review
  - What they'll be able to do once approved
  - Expected review timeline (2-3 business days)

### 3. Disabled Features During Pending Approval
When a supplier is pending approval, the following features are disabled:
- **Add New Product** button (shows as disabled with "Pending Approval" text)
- **View Orders** button (shows as disabled with "Pending Approval" text)
- **Manage Products** button (shows as disabled with "Pending Approval" text)
- **Manage Orders** button (shows as disabled with "Pending Approval" text)

### 4. Updated UI Elements
- Product Management section shows: "Product management will be available once your profile is approved"
- Order Management section shows: "Order management will be available once your profile is approved"
- Orders section shows: "Orders will appear here once your profile is approved"

## Technical Implementation

### Models Updated
- `SupplierInformation`: Added status constants (`STATUS_PENDING_APPROVAL`, `STATUS_ACTIVE`, etc.)

### Controllers Updated
- `OnboardingController`: Updated completion message and sets status to pending approval
- `DashboardController`: Added logic to detect pending approval state

### Views Updated
- `supplier/dashboard.blade.php`: Added conditional rendering for pending approval state

## Production Deployment

### Database Changes
No new migrations are required as the `status` field already exists in the `supplier_information` table.

### Configuration
No additional configuration is needed.

### Testing
1. Complete supplier onboarding as a new supplier
2. Verify the success message appears with the review information
3. Verify the dashboard shows the pending approval message
4. Verify all product and order management features are disabled
5. Verify the UI clearly communicates what will be available after approval

## Admin Actions Required
Admins need to:
1. Review supplier profiles in the admin panel
2. Approve supplier category assignments
3. Set supplier status to 'active' when approved
4. Notify suppliers when their profile is approved

## Future Enhancements
- Add email notifications when profile is approved/rejected
- Add admin dashboard for managing pending supplier approvals
- Add ability for suppliers to track their approval status
- Add automated approval workflows for certain criteria
