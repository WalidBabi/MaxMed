<title><![CDATA[ALP Rapid Test Strip - Veterinary Diagnostics]]></title>
<link>http://localhost/products/alp-rapid-test-strip-mt-0123-maxtest-dubai-uae</link>
<description><![CDATA[Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme naturally present in all raw milks, which is used as
 an indicator of proper milk pasteurization. Complete pasteurization will inactivate the enzyme
 to below levels which are detectable by conventional methods. Because the heat stability of
 ALP is greater than that of pathogens which may be present in milk, the enzyme serves as an
 indicator of product safety. However, the failure to detect ALP activity does not guarantee that
 the product is pathogen free. The current ALP rapid test kit is based on chemical reaction of
 ALP with its substrate to detect ALP activity in pasteurized milk. It is specific and accurate. | Category: Veterinary Diagnostics | Contact MaxMed UAE for pricing.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Aflatoxin M1 Rapid Test Kit 0.05ppb - Veterinary Diagnostics]]></title>
<link>http://localhost/products/aflatoxin-m1-rapid-test-kit-005ppb-mt-0121-maxtest-dubai-uae</link>
<description><![CDATA[Aflatoxins are naturally occurring mycotoxins, which are extremely toxic and among the most carcinogenic 
substances known. After entering the animal body, aflatoxins may be metabolized by the liver t a new substance - 
aflatoxin M1. Thus it is of great importance to monitor the residue of aflatoxin M1 in foods, especially in daily 
consumptions, such as milk and many other dairy products. 
This product utilizes the high affinity of monoclonal antibody against aflatoxin M1, which can easily identify its 
contamination in milk without any instrument. The detection limit of the kit can meet both European and USA MRLs 
when use properly. | Category: Veterinary Diagnostics | Contact MaxMed UAE for pricing.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Melamine Rapid Test Kit - Veterinary Diagnostics]]></title>
<link>http://localhost/products/melamine-rapid-test-kit-mt-0122-maxtest-dubai-uae</link>
<description><![CDATA[Melamine is a common industry chemical, which was used illegally in milk to increase the protein content 
measured by classic Kjeldahl method. Milk products prepared from milk contaminated with melamine will directly 
damage the urinary system, for instance, it will cause kidney stone in infant, whose main food is milk powder. FAO 
has set a strict MRL to melamine in milk, other countries, such as China, USA also set MRLs. 
This product utilizes the high affinity of monoclonal antibody against melamine, which can easily identify its 
contamination in samples without any instrument. The detection limit of the kit is 30ppb. | Category: Veterinary Diagnostics | Contact MaxMed UAE for pricing.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Using different color scales to mark the pipettes helps users quickly identify the required pipetter, reducing the risk of choosing the wrong range and improving experimental efficiency and accuracy.
For novice experimental personnel, identifying different colors makes it easier to understand and remember, simplifying the training process.
Different colors also help organize and manage pipettes within the laboratory, making it more orderly.
DLAB's new generation of fully autoclavable manual pipettes feature an excellent ergonomic design with an ultra-light body weighing less than 100g, reducing fatigue and offering a smoother, more comfortable pipetting experience;
The pipettes are easy to press with a first stop force of 4N and a second stop force of 10N, providing a comfortable single-handed pipetting experience;
The single-channel adjustable range includes 10, covering 0.1ul to 10ml;
A new piston structure and screw mechanism ensure precise aspiration and dispensing, with a counter increment of one-thousandth of the range;
A one-button range lock effectively prevents pipetting errors due to misoperation and aids in the accurate transfer of small volumes of liquid;
The range adjustment is smooth and tactile;
Constructed with new materials, the pipettes are autoclavable without disassembly, UV sterilizable, and resistant to strong chemical corrosion;
They come with a separate filter to reduce volatile reagents from entering the body, preventing over-aspiration and piston corrosion due to improper operation;
Easy to disassemble for maintenance; with the accessory tools provided, calibration and repairs can be conveniently and quickly performed. | Category: Lab Essentials (Tubes, Pipettes, Glassware) | Contact MaxMed UAE for pricing.]]></description>
