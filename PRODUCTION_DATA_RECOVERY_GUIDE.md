# 🚨 PRODUCTION DATA RECOVERY GUIDE

## **CRITICAL ISSUE: Development Data Overwrote Production Deliveries**

Your production deliveries data was replaced with development data during a recent deployment. This guide will help you recover the data and prevent future incidents.

## **IMMEDIATE RECOVERY STEPS**

### **Step 1: Check for Database Backups**

```bash
# SSH into your production server
ssh your-production-server

# Check for automated database backups
ls -la /var/backups/mysql/
ls -la /backup/
ls -la ~/backups/

# Check if your hosting provider has automated backups
# (DigitalOcean, AWS RDS, etc. usually have automated backups)
```

### **Step 2: Restore from Most Recent Backup**

If you have a backup from before the deployment:

```bash
# Example backup restoration (adjust paths as needed)
mysql -u root -p maxmed_production < /path/to/backup/maxmed_backup_YYYY-MM-DD.sql

# Or if you have table-specific backups:
mysql -u root -p maxmed_production -e "DROP TABLE deliveries;"
mysql -u root -p maxmed_production < /path/to/backup/deliveries_table_backup.sql
```

### **Step 3: If No Backups Available**

If you don't have backups, check these sources:

1. **Hosting Provider Backups**: Most providers have automated backups
2. **Application Logs**: May contain delivery creation logs
3. **Email Records**: Delivery notifications might help reconstruct data
4. **Customer Records**: Contact customers to verify recent deliveries

## **PREVENTION MEASURES**

### **Step 1: Fix Git Tracking Issues**

The compiled view files should NOT be in Git. I've already fixed this by:

1. ✅ Added compiled views to `.gitignore`
2. ✅ Removed existing compiled views from Git tracking

### **Step 2: Implement Proper Deployment Process**

Create a proper deployment script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy.sh - Safe Production Deployment

echo "=== SAFE PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT ==="

# 1. NEVER run migrations that drop/truncate data in production
echo "Checking for dangerous migrations..."
php artisan migrate:status

# 2. Backup database before any changes
echo "Creating backup..."
mysqldump -u $DB_USERNAME -p$DB_PASSWORD $DB_DATABASE > "backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql"

# 3. Pull code changes
git pull origin main

# 4. Install dependencies
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

# 5. Run safe migrations only
php artisan migrate --force

# 6. Clear caches (this is safe)
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan route:clear

# 7. Optimize for production
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache

echo "=== DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE ==="
```

### **Step 3: Database Migration Safety**

Check your migrations for data-destroying operations:

```php
// ❌ DANGEROUS - Never do this in production migrations
Schema::dropIfExists('deliveries');
DB::table('deliveries')->truncate();

// ✅ SAFE - Always preserve existing data
if (!Schema::hasTable('deliveries')) {
    Schema::create('deliveries', function (Blueprint $table) {
        // table definition
    });
}
```

### **Step 4: Environment Separation**

Ensure you have separate databases:
- Development: `maxmed_dev`
- Production: `maxmed_production`

Never use the same database for both environments.

## **WHAT LIKELY HAPPENED**

Based on your codebase, the issue occurred because:

1. **Compiled views were committed to Git** (now fixed)
2. **Migration ran that reset deliveries table**
3. **Development database was used in production**
4. **No backup before deployment**

## **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Immediate**: Restore from backup if available
2. **Short-term**: Implement the safe deployment script
3. **Long-term**: Set up automated daily database backups

## **BACKUP AUTOMATION**

Set up daily backups with this cron job:

```bash
# Add to crontab: crontab -e
0 2 * * * mysqldump -u root -p$DB_PASSWORD maxmed_production > /backup/maxmed_$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).sql
```

## **EMERGENCY CONTACTS**

If data recovery is critical:
1. Contact your hosting provider immediately
2. Check if they have point-in-time recovery
3. Consider professional data recovery services

**Remember**: Always backup before deploying to production!
