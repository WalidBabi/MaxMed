# Supplier Category Email Notifications

This document describes the email notification system implemented for supplier category approval and rejection.

## Overview

When an admin approves or rejects a supplier's category request, the system now automatically sends email notifications to the supplier. The implementation includes both direct email sending and Laravel notifications for flexibility.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `app/Mail/SupplierCategoryApprovalMail.php` - Mail class for category approval/rejection emails
2. `app/Notifications/SupplierCategoryApprovalNotification.php` - Notification class for category approval/rejection
3. `resources/views/emails/supplier-category-approved.blade.php` - Email template for approvals
4. `resources/views/emails/supplier-category-rejected.blade.php` - Email template for rejections

### Modified Files
1. `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/SupplierCategoryController.php` - Added email and notification sending logic

## Features

### Email Notifications
- **Approval Emails**: Sent when a category request is approved
  - Includes category details, approval information, and next steps
  - Provides direct link to supplier dashboard
  - Professional, branded email template

- **Rejection Emails**: Sent when a category request is rejected
  - Includes category details and review information
  - Provides guidance on next steps
  - Links to contact support

### Dual Notification System
The system uses both:
1. **Direct Mail Sending**: Using Laravel's Mail facade
2. **Laravel Notifications**: Using the notification system for consistency with other parts of the application

## Implementation Details

### Mail Class
- `SupplierCategoryApprovalMail` handles both approval and rejection emails
- Uses different email templates based on the `isApproved` parameter
- Includes all necessary data: supplier, category, approval details

### Email Templates
- Responsive HTML email templates
- Consistent with MaxMed branding
- Mobile-friendly design
- Professional styling with clear call-to-action buttons

### Controller Integration
- Email sending is wrapped in try-catch blocks for error handling
- Failed email attempts are logged for debugging
- Both approval and rejection methods send notifications

## Production Implementation

### 1. Email Configuration
Ensure your production environment has proper email configuration in `.env`:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=your-smtp-host
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@maxmed.ae
MAIL_FROM_NAME="MaxMed Scientific & Laboratory Equipment"
```

### 2. Queue Configuration (Recommended)
For better performance, configure queues for email sending:

```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

Then run:
```bash
php artisan queue:table
php artisan migrate
php artisan queue:work
```

### 3. Email Template Assets
Ensure the MaxMed logo is accessible in production:
- Upload `Images/logo.png` to your production server
- Verify the asset path in email templates

### 4. Testing
Test the email functionality:
1. Create a test supplier account
2. Submit a category request
3. Approve/reject the request as an admin
4. Verify emails are received

### 5. Monitoring
Monitor email delivery:
- Check Laravel logs for email errors
- Set up email delivery monitoring
- Consider using services like Mailgun or SendGrid for better deliverability

## Customization

### Email Content
- Modify email templates in `resources/views/emails/`
- Update branding, colors, and messaging as needed
- Add additional information fields if required

### Notification Channels
The notification class can be extended to support additional channels:
- Database notifications
- SMS notifications
- Slack notifications
- etc.

### Email Templates
- Templates use inline CSS for maximum email client compatibility
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- Test across different email clients (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Emails not sending**: Check mail configuration and SMTP settings
2. **Template errors**: Verify asset paths and Blade syntax
3. **Queue issues**: Ensure queue workers are running
4. **Missing data**: Check that all required model relationships are loaded

### Debugging
- Check Laravel logs for error messages
- Use `php artisan tinker` to test mail sending
- Verify email templates render correctly

## Security Considerations

- Email addresses are validated before sending
- Error handling prevents sensitive information leakage
- Logging is implemented for audit trails
- Rate limiting should be considered for production

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add email preferences for suppliers
2. Implement email templates in multiple languages
3. Add email tracking and analytics
4. Create email digests for multiple category changes
5. Add SMS notifications as an alternative
