    "description": "Aflatoxins are naturally occurring mycotoxins, which are extremely toxic and among the most carcinogenic \r\nsubstances known. After entering the animal body, aflatoxins may be metabolized by the liver t a new substance - \r\naflatoxin M1. Thus it is of great importance to monitor the residue of aflatoxin M1 in foods, especially in daily \r\nconsumptions, such as milk and many other dairy products. \r\nThis product utilizes the high affinity of monoclonal antibody against aflatoxin M1, which can easily identify its \r\ncontamination in milk without any instrument. The detection limit of the kit can meet both European and USA MRLs \r\nwhen use properly. MaxMed UAE is the leading supplier of Food Test Kits in Dubai and across the United Arab Emirates. We provide professional Food Test Kits with same-day quotes, fast delivery, installation support, and comprehensive after-sales service.
