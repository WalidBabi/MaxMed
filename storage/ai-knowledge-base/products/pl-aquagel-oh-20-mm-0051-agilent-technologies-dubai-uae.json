    "description": "PL aquagel-OH columns offer efficient and reliable aqueous GPC\/SEC separation of water-soluble polymers and large molecules, such as PEG, polysorbate, starch, dextran, and acrylamide. PL aquagel-OH columns meet USP L25, tolerate high buffer concentrations, pH 2 to 10, temperatures up to 90 °C, and organic solvents (up to 50% methanol).\r\n\r\nRapid and predictable scale-up of analytical SEC to milligram and gram quantities is easy with both analytical- and preparative-scale PL aquagel-OH columns. The analytical grade 8 µm media in PL aquagel-OH preparative columns provides higher separation speed and resolution, enabling precise cuts with high recovery and purity.\r\n\r\n\r\nEfficient and reliable size exclusion chromatography (SEC) column\r\nMeets USP L25, tolerates high buffer concentrations, pH range 2–10, temperatures up to 90 °C, and organic solvents (up to 50% methanol)\r\nVarious column configuration options provide tailored separations\r\nWell-tested resistance against interaction with neutral, multiply charged, polyanionic, and polycationic samples\r\nEasy scale-up to from analytical to preparative SEC\r\nHigh-resolution preparative 8 µm media gives faster runs, higher purity cuts, and better recovery than larger, broader distribution particles MaxMed UAE is the leading supplier of Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) in Dubai and across the United Arab Emirates. We provide professional Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) with same-day quotes, fast delivery, installation support, and comprehensive after-sales service.
