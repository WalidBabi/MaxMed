    "description": "The Sterilization Pouches utilize a transparent compound film for easy tool organization when cleaning. Each pouch also has an external indicator system that changes color once sterilization is done, depending on the method used. The indicator arrow turns brown on steam or autoclave and yellow when EO is processed. The tool bags also feature a reliable sealing system that ensures a tight seal without the need for any professional sealing device or added heat. The system also makes sure to prevent penetration as well tears and other damages that may be caused by sharp tools. The bag’s adhesive strip can serve as a thumb notch to prevent burns when sterilizing.\r\n\r\nGENC-5028 Sterilization Pouch (Self Sealing Flat Pouch) 2.25 ”x 4”(57 x100mm), Paper + Blue Film 200pcs\/box,30boxes\/ctn\r\nGENC-5029 Sterilization Pouch (Self Sealing Flat Pouch) 2.75″ X 10″ (70x260mm ) Paper + Blue Film, 200pcs\/box,20box\/ctn\r\nGENC-1068 Sterilization Pouch (Self Sealing Flat Pouch) 3.5” x 6.5” (90x165mm) , Paper + Blue Film 200pcs\/box,40box\/ctn\r\nGENC-1059 Sterilization Pouch (Self Sealing Flat Pouch) 3.5″ X 10″ (90x260mm ), Paper + Blue Film 200pcs\/box, 20 box\/ctn\r\nGENC-1065 Sterilization Pouch (Self Sealing Flat Pouch) 6′ x 9″ (140 X 230 mm) Paper + Blue Film 200pcs\/box,10box\/ctn\r\nGENC-1069 Sterilization Pouch (Self Sealing Flat Pouch) 7.5″ X 13″ (190x330mm) , Paper + Blue Film 200pcs\/box, 5box\/ctn\r\nGENC-1069 Sterilization Pouch (Self Sealing Flat Pouch) 11.8″ X 18″ (300x460mm) , Paper + Blue Film 200pcs\/box, 5box\/ctn MaxMed UAE is the leading supplier of Dental Consumables in Dubai and across the United Arab Emirates.
