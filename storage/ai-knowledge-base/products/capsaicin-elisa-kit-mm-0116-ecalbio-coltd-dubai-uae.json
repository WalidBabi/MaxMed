    "description": "This test kit is a competitive ELISA for the quantitative analysis of Capsaicin in the rapeseed oil, soybean oil, peanut oil, corn oil, blended oil, etc. The coupling antigens are pre-coated on the micro-well stripes. The Capsaicin in the sample and the coupling antigens pre-coated on the micro-well stripes compete for the anti-Cap antibodies. After the addition of the enzyme conjugate, the TMB substrate is added for coloration. The optical density (OD) value of the sample has a negative correlation with Capsaicin concentration in the sample. This value is compared to the standard curve and the content of the corresponding Capsaicin is subsequently obtained. \r\n\r\nSensitivity : 1ppb     \r\nDetect time: Approx. 30 min MaxMed UAE is the leading supplier of Chemical & Reagents in Dubai and across the United Arab Emirates. We provide professional Chemical & Reagents with same-day quotes, fast delivery, installation support, and comprehensive after-sales service.
