    "description": "The instrument is equipped with a 10.1-inch large color touch screen (1024*600), designed with an easy-to-use graphical user interface.\r\nThe main unit independently performs photometric measurement, quantitative analysis, spectrum scanning, kinetics, DNA\/protein testing, and multi-wavelength testing.\r\nWhen controlled via PC software, it provides richer extension applications. The software adheres to GLP\/GMP laboratory standards and includes comprehensive user management, log recording, data storage traceability, and report output functions.\r\nIt boasts powerful storage capabilities, able to save various types of data and spectra, equipped with a standard USB interface for direct data exportation for editing, measurement, and storage. The instrument also features a power-off data retention function.\r\nThe unique design provides excellent optical performance, utilizing a holographic grating monochromator and a digital photodiode detector, ensuring low stray light, low noise, and high photometric accuracy and stability.\r\nA new wavelength drive mechanism greatly improves wavelength accuracy and repeatability while significantly reducing operational noise.\r\nIt supports a wide range of optional accessories, including a wireless Bluetooth printer, automatic cell holder, film sample holder, tube cell holder, thermostatic bath holder, optical integrating sphere, reflectance attachment, variable path length sample holder, and variable angle solid sample holder, among other specialized accessories.\r\n\r\nPRODUCT PARAMETERS\r\nOptical System\r\nSingle Beam\r\nLight Source\r\nTungsten Lamp(Japan HYBEC) | Deuterium Lamp (Milaras)\r\nSpectral Bandwidth\r\n2.0nm\r\nWavelength Range\r\n190～1100nm\r\nWavelength Accuracy\r\n±0.1nm (at 656.1nm), ±0.3nm full range\r\nScanning Speed\r\nHigh | Medium | Slow\r\nWavelength Repeatability\r\n≤0.1nm\r\nPhotometric Range\r\n-0.3～3A,0～9999C(0～9999F)\r\nPhotometric Accuracy\r\n±0.002A(0～0.5A)±0.003A(0.5A～1A)\r\nPhotometric Repeatability\r\n±0.001A(0～0.5A)±0.0015A(0.5A～1A)\r\nStability\r\n≤0.001 A\/h \/ 500 nm(After 1 hour of preheating)\r\nStray Light\r\n≤0.05%T @ 220,360nm\r\nSample Compartment\r\n4 Cells, 10mm\r\nDisplay\r\n10.1-inch large color touch screen(1024*600)\r\nOutput\r\nUSB Port Printer Port\r\nPower Requirements\r\n110\/220V,50\/60Hz,120W\r\nDimension[L×W×H]\r\n570*440*210mm\r\nWeight\r\n20KG MaxMed UAE is the leading supplier of UV-Vis Spectrophotometers in Dubai and across the United Arab Emirates.
