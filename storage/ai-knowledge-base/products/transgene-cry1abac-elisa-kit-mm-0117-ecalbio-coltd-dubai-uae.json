    "description": "Transgene Cry1Ab\/Ac ELISA Kit is a competitive enzyme immunoassay for the quantitative analysis of Transgene Cry1Ab\/Ac soybean, wheat, corn, rice with extruded material, protein isolate samples. \r\nAn antibody with a affinity for Cry1Ab\/Ac is coated onto microwells. Standard or sample is added to the appropiate well and if Cry1Ab\/Ac is present it will bind to the coated antibody. Subsequently, Cry1Ab\/Ac bound to horse-radish peroxidase (HRP) is added and binds to the antibody not already occupied by Cry1Ab\/Ac present in the sample or standard. After this incubation period, the contents of the wells are decanted, washed and an HRP substrate is added which develops a blue color in the present of an enzyme. The resulting color intensity, has an inverse relationship with the target concentration in the sample. The levels of Cry1Ab\/Ac in the sample are determined by comparison of the color intensity of unknown samples with the standard curve, which is made using the Cry1Ab\/Ac standards provided in the kit.\r\nCry1Ab\/Ac ELISA Kit incorporates a fast, low-cost sample prep protocol with high recovery rates.\r\n\r\nSensitivity :  0.10 ppb\r\nSpecification:  96 tests \/kit MaxMed UAE is the leading supplier of Chemical & Reagents in Dubai and across the United Arab Emirates. We provide professional Chemical & Reagents with same-day quotes, fast delivery, installation support, and comprehensive after-sales service.
