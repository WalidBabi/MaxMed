    "description": "Melamine is a common industry chemical, which was used illegally in milk to increase the protein content \r\nmeasured by classic Kjeldahl method. Milk products prepared from milk contaminated with melamine will directly \r\ndamage the urinary system, for instance, it will cause kidney stone in infant, whose main food is milk powder. FAO \r\nhas set a strict MRL to melamine in milk, other countries, such as China, USA also set MRLs. \r\nThis product utilizes the high affinity of monoclonal antibody against melamine, which can easily identify its \r\ncontamination in samples without any instrument. The detection limit of the kit is 30ppb. MaxMed UAE is the leading supplier of Food Test Kits in Dubai and across the United Arab Emirates. We provide professional Food Test Kits with same-day quotes, fast delivery, installation support, and comprehensive after-sales service.
