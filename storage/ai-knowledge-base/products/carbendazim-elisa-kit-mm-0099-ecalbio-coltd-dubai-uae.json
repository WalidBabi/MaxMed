    "description": "Carbendazim ELISA kit is a competitive enzyme immunoassay for the quantitative analysis of Carbendazim in the fruit, plant isolate, vegetable and tea samples. \r\nThe coupling antigens are coated on the micro-well stripes. The Carbendazim in the sample and the coupling antigens coated on the micro-well stripes compete for the anti-Carbendazim antibodies. After the addition of the enzyme conjugate, the TMB substrate is added for coloration.\r\nThe optical density (OD) value of the sample has a negative correlation with the Carbendazim in it. The measurement is made photometrically at 450nm. The absorption is inversely proportional to the Carbendazim concentration in the sample. MaxMed UAE is the leading supplier of Chemical & Reagents in Dubai and across the United Arab Emirates. We provide professional Chemical & Reagents with same-day quotes, fast delivery, installation support, and comprehensive after-sales service. Contact us at +971 55 460 2500 for expert consultation and competitive pricing.",
