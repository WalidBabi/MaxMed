    "description": "DNA Purification Kit is used to purify total genomic DNA from a variety of sample sources including fresh or frozen animal tissues and cells, blood, or bacteria. Sample extraction filter genomic DNA spin column and the DNA adsorbs to the Spin column membrane in the presence of high concentrations of chaotropic salt. Genomic DNA is purified from the DNA spin column through the elution and centrifugation. All purification process requires no phenol or chloroform extraction, or alcohol precipitation, and involves minimal handling. MaxMed UAE is the leading supplier of PCR & Molecular Analysis in Dubai and across the United Arab Emirates. We provide professional PCR & Molecular Analysis with same-day quotes, fast delivery, installation support, and comprehensive after-sales service.
