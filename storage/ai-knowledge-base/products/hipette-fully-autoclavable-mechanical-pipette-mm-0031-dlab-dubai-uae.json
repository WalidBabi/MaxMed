    "description": "Introducing the new generation of fully autoclavable manual pipettes - the DLAB pipette.\r\nErgonomic Design: The DLAB pipette is designed with excellent ergonomics that reduce fatigue and provide a smoother and easier pipetting experience.\r\nSmooth and Effortless Operation: With a one-stop point of 4N and two-stop points of 10N, the DLAB pipette offers a comfortable single-handed pipetting experience with smooth and effortless operation.\r\nMultiple Volume Range: The DLAB pipette offers 12 different single-channel adjustable volume , ranging from 0.1 µl to 10 ml, making it ideal for various laboratory applications.\r\nPrecise Volume Setting: The DLAB pipette features a new piston and metal screw structure, ensuring precise suction and dispensing of liquids. Its counter increment is one thousandth of the volume range, making it easy to set and read.\r\nOne-Click Volume Lock: The DLAB pipette has a one-click volume lock feature that helps prevent pipetting errors caused by accidental volume changes, allowing for more accurate transfer of small volumes of liquids.\r\nSmooth Volume Adjustment: The DLAB pipette offers a smooth and easy volume adjustment experience, ensuring high precision and accuracy.\r\nHigh-Quality Materials: The DLAB pipette is made of a new type of material that does not require disassembly for autoclaving or UV disinfection, and is resistant to harsh chemicals.\r\nIndividual Filter System: The DLAB pipette is equipped with an individual filter system that reduces volatile reagents from entering the pipette and causing over-aspiration or corrosion of the piston.\r\nEasy Maintenance: The DLAB pipette is easy to disassemble and comes with tools that can be used to calibrate and maintain the pipette in the laboratory.\r\nCertifications: The DLAB pipette has ISO9001:2015 and ISO 13485:2016 certifications, as well as CE marking, ensuring its quality and reliability.\r\nOnline Calibration: The DLAB pipette can be calibrated online via the official website, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.\r\nOverall, the DLAB pipette is a reliable, easy-to-use, and precise manual pipette that is ideal for various laboratory applications. With its ergonomic design, precise volume setting, and high-quality materials, the DLAB pipette is the ideal choice for any laboratory looking for a reliable and efficient pipette.
