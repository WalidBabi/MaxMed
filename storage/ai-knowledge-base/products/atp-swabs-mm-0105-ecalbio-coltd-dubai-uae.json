    "description": "The Surface ATP Swab is a stand-alone device for use with a handheld ATP biofluorescence detector. It is used to monitor thesanitary conditions on the surfaces of processing units and various other industrial environments. The system works by measuring adenosine triphosphate (ATP), an energy molecule commonly found in the cells of all animals, plants, bacteria, yeast and molds. ATP is contained in organic products left on surfaces. microbial contamination of surfaces contains ATP, but usually in small amounts. After proper cleaning, it should be possible to substantially reduce all sources of ATP. After a sample is collected and exposed to the unique liquid stabilized luciferase\/luciferin reagent in the surface ATP detection swab device, the light emitted is proportional to the amount of ATP present in the sample. the ATP detector measures the light produced and reports the result in relative luminescence intensity units (RLU). the RLU result provides information on the level of contamination within seconds. a higher RLU number indicates that more ATP is present The higher the number, the dirtier the surface. It is important to note that the ATP detection swab is designed to detect invisible\/trace residues. If a visibly dirty surface is wiped, the swab will be overloaded with material that will subsequently inhibit the bioluminescence response, resulting in inaccurate results. For liquid samples, liquid ATP assay swabs are used, contact your salesperson for details. MaxMed UAE is the leading supplier of Toxin & Hygiene Detection in Dubai and across the United Arab Emirates. We provide professional Toxin & Hygiene Detection with same-day quotes, fast delivery, installation support, and comprehensive after-sales service.
