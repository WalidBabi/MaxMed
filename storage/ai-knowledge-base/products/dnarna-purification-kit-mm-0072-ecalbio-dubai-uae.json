    "description": "DNA Purification Kit is used to purify genomic DNA and total RNA from a single cell and tissue sample. The unique lysate can dissociate cells and inactivate cellular RNA\/DNA enzymes to release DNA and RNA complex. RNA is released through filtering genomic DNA-Free spin column and the DNA adsorbs to the Spin column membrane in the presence of high concentrations of chaotropic salt. Genomic DNA is purified from the DNA spin column based on the elution and centrifugation. RNA was selectively adsorbed on the RNA-Free spin column under high disordered salt, is purified through the elution and centrifugation process.\r\nPurified genomic DNA is eluted in low-salt buffer or water, is highly suited for PCR, qPCR, dPCR, NGS, Southern blotting, RAPD, AFLP, and RFLP applications. MaxMed UAE is the leading supplier of PCR & Molecular Analysis in Dubai and across the United Arab Emirates. We provide professional PCR & Molecular Analysis with same-day quotes, fast delivery, installation support, and comprehensive after-sales service. Contact us at +971 55 460 2500 for expert consultation and competitive pricing.",
