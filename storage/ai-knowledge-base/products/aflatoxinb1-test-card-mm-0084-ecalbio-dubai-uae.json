    "description": "AflatoxinB1 test card is based on lateral flow immunochromatographic assay. The test device has a testing window. The testing window has an invisible T (test) zone and C (control) zone. When sample is applied into the sample hole on the device, the liquid will laterally flow on the surface of the test strip. If there is little AflatoxinB1 in the sample, a visible T band will appear; T band is invisible if it has more AflatoxinB1 in the sample. The C band should always appear after a sample is applied, indicating a valid result. By this means, the device can accurately indicate the presence of AflatoxinB1 in the Edible oil ,feed,corn,wheat,grains.
