    "description": "To measure Ochratoxin levels, samples are prepared by mixing with an extraction solution, followed by blending and filtering. The extract is then applied to the Ochratoxin A column, which contains specific antibodies for Ochratoxin A. At this stage, the ochratoxin binds to the antibody on the column. The column is then washed to rid the immunoaffinity column of impurities. By passing methanol through the column, the ochratoxin is removed from the antibody. The methanol can then be injected into an HPLC or LC-MS system. MaxMed UAE is the leading supplier of Toxin & Hygiene Detection in Dubai and across the United Arab Emirates. We provide professional Toxin & Hygiene Detection with same-day quotes, fast delivery, installation support, and comprehensive after-sales service.
