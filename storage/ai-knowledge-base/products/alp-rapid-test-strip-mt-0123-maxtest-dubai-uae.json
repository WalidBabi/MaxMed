    "description": "Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme naturally present in all raw milks, which is used as\r\n an indicator of proper milk pasteurization. Complete pasteurization will inactivate the enzyme\r\n to below levels which are detectable by conventional methods. Because the heat stability of\r\n ALP is greater than that of pathogens which may be present in milk, the enzyme serves as an\r\n indicator of product safety. However, the failure to detect ALP activity does not guarantee that\r\n the product is pathogen free. The current ALP rapid test kit is based on chemical reaction of\r\n ALP with its substrate to detect ALP activity in pasteurized milk. It is specific and accurate. MaxMed UAE is the leading supplier of Food Test Kits in Dubai and across the United Arab Emirates. We provide professional Food Test Kits with same-day quotes, fast delivery, installation support, and comprehensive after-sales service.
