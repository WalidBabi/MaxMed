The certified value (purity of AflatoxinB1) is based on the results of mass balance method and qNMR method. Structure related impurities are determined by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS). Moisture content, inorganic impurities and volatile organic compounds are measured by Karl Fischer, ICP-MS and GC-FID respectively. Based on the above results, the purity certification value is given. MaxMed UAE is the leading supplier of Chemical & Reagents in Dubai and across the United Arab Emirates.
