    "description": "Using different color scales to mark the pipettes helps users quickly identify the required pipetter, reducing the risk of choosing the wrong range and improving experimental efficiency and accuracy.\r\nFor novice experimental personnel, identifying different colors makes it easier to understand and remember, simplifying the training process.\r\nDifferent colors also help organize and manage pipettes within the laboratory, making it more orderly.\r\nDLAB's new generation of fully autoclavable manual pipettes feature an excellent ergonomic design with an ultra-light body weighing less than 100g, reducing fatigue and offering a smoother, more comfortable pipetting experience;\r\nThe pipettes are easy to press with a first stop force of 4N and a second stop force of 10N, providing a comfortable single-handed pipetting experience;\r\nThe single-channel adjustable range includes 10, covering 0.1ul to 10ml;\r\nA new piston structure and screw mechanism ensure precise aspiration and dispensing, with a counter increment of one-thousandth of the range;\r\nA one-button range lock effectively prevents pipetting errors due to misoperation and aids in the accurate transfer of small volumes of liquid;\r\nThe range adjustment is smooth and tactile;\r\nConstructed with new materials, the pipettes are autoclavable without disassembly, UV sterilizable, and resistant to strong chemical corrosion;\r\nThey come with a separate filter to reduce volatile reagents from entering the body, preventing over-aspiration and piston corrosion due to improper operation;\r\nEasy to disassemble for maintenance; with the accessory tools provided, calibration and repairs can be conveniently and quickly performed.
