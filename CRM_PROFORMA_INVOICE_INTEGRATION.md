# CRM Proforma Invoice Integration & Pipeline Updates

## Overview
Extended the CRM lead status automation to include:
1. Automatic CRM lead updates when sending proforma invoices
2. Added "Quote Sent" and "Proforma Sent" stages to the sales pipeline
3. Intelligent status updates based on document type (quote vs proforma vs regular invoice)

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `database/migrations/2025_10_07_123124_add_quote_sent_and_proforma_sent_statuses_to_crm_leads.php`

- Added `proforma_sent` status to the CRM leads status enum
- Note: `quote_sent` status already existed in the system
- New pipeline flow: `quote_sent` → `proforma_sent` → `payment_pending`

**New Status Values:**
- `quote_sent` - Set when a quote is emailed to customer
- `proforma_sent` - Set when a proforma invoice is emailed to customer
- Other statuses remain unchanged

### 2. Invoice Controller Enhancement
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/InvoiceController.php`

**Changes to `sendEmail()` method:**
- Added `CrmLead` model import
- After successful email send, searches for CRM lead by email
- Updates lead status based on invoice type:
  - **Proforma Invoice** → CRM status changes to `proforma_sent`
  - **Regular Invoice** → CRM status changes to `payment_pending`
- Updates `last_contacted_at` timestamp
- Logs all status changes for audit trail
- Returns enhanced success messages indicating CRM update and invoice type

**Logic Flow:**
```php
if (invoice type is proforma) {
    CRM status = 'proforma_sent'
} else {
    CRM status = 'payment_pending'
}
```

### 3. Quote Controller (Previously Implemented)
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/QuoteController.php`

- When quote email is sent → CRM status changes to `quote_sent`
- Saves customer email to quote record
- Updates lead's last contacted timestamp

### 4. CRM Pipeline View Updates
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/CrmLeadController.php`

**Updated Pipeline Stages:**
Added two new stages to the `getPipelineData()` method:
- `quote_sent` → 📤 Quote Sent (cyan color)
- `proforma_sent` → 📄 Proforma Sent (purple color)

**Complete Pipeline Flow:**
1. 📩 New Inquiry
2. 💰 Quote Requested
3. 🔍 Getting Price
4. 📋 Price Submitted
5. **📤 Quote Sent** ← NEW
6. **📄 Proforma Sent** ← NEW
7. ⏰ Follow-up 1
8. 🔔 Follow-up 2
9. 🚨 Follow-up 3
10. 🤝 Price Negotiation
11. 💳 Payment Pending
12. ✅ Order Confirmed
13. ❌ Deal Lost

### 5. CRM Lead Model Updates
**File:** `app/Models/CrmLead.php`

**Updated `getStatusColorAttribute()`:**
- Added `quote_sent` → `cyan` color mapping
- Added `proforma_sent` → `purple` color mapping
- Ensures proper color coding in pipeline view

**Updated Status Validation in CrmLeadController:**
- Added `quote_sent` and `proforma_sent` to valid statuses list
- Updated validation rules to include new statuses

## How It Works

### Sending a Quote Email:
1. User clicks email button on quote
2. Enters customer email address
3. Clicks "Send Email"
4. System:
   - Sends quote email
   - Updates quote status to 'sent'
   - **Finds CRM lead by email**
   - **Updates lead status to 'quote_sent'**
   - Shows: "Quote email sent successfully! CRM lead status updated to 'Quote Sent'."

### Sending a Proforma Invoice Email:
1. User clicks email button on proforma invoice
2. Enters customer email address
3. Clicks "Send Email"
4. System:
   - Sends proforma invoice email
   - Updates invoice status to 'sent'
   - **Finds CRM lead by email**
   - **Updates lead status to 'proforma_sent'**
   - Shows: "Proforma invoice sent successfully! CRM lead status updated to 'Proforma Sent'."

### Sending a Regular Invoice Email:
1. User clicks email button on regular invoice
2. Enters customer email address
3. Clicks "Send Email"
4. System:
   - Sends invoice email
   - Updates invoice status to 'sent'
   - **Finds CRM lead by email**
   - **Updates lead status to 'payment_pending'**
   - Shows: "Invoice sent successfully! CRM lead status updated to 'Payment Pending'."

- **Proforma Sent**: Customer has received a proforma invoice and is preparing payment
- **Payment Pending**: Customer has received a final invoice and payment is expected

## Testing

### Test Quote Email:
1. Create a CRM lead with email: `test@example.com`
2. Create a quote for that customer
3. Send quote via email to `test@example.com`
4. Verify:
   - Email sent successfully
   - Quote status = 'sent'
   - CRM lead status = 'quote_sent'
   - Lead appears in "📤 Quote Sent" pipeline column
   - Success message mentions CRM update

### Test Proforma Invoice Email:
1. Use existing CRM lead or create new one
2. Create a proforma invoice for that customer
3. Send proforma via email
4. Verify:
   - Email sent successfully
   - Invoice status = 'sent'
   - CRM lead status = 'proforma_sent'
   - Lead appears in "📄 Proforma Sent" pipeline column
   - Success message mentions "Proforma Sent"

### Test Regular Invoice Email:
1. Use existing CRM lead or create new one
2. Create a regular invoice for that customer
3. Send invoice via email
4. Verify:
   - Email sent successfully
   - Invoice status = 'sent'
   - CRM lead status = 'payment_pending'
   - Lead appears in "💳 Payment Pending" pipeline column
   - Success message mentions "Payment Pending"

## Error Handling

- If email sending fails, no CRM updates occur (transaction-like behavior)
- If no matching CRM lead exists, documents still send successfully
- All errors are logged with full context
- Users receive appropriate error/success messages
- Email matching is case-insensitive

## Technical Notes

- Email matching uses customer email address
- Only the first matching lead by email is updated
- Works seamlessly with existing workflows
- No changes required to CRM module (automatic)
- Pipeline drag-and-drop still works normally
- All existing statuses remain functional

## API Responses

```json

    "success": true,

    "crm_lead_updated": true
