# CRM Quote Email Integration

## Overview
This implementation automatically updates CRM leads to "Quote Sent" status when a quotation email is sent to a customer.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `database/migrations/2025_10_07_115647_add_customer_email_to_quotes_table.php`

- Added `customer_email` field to the `quotes` table
- This field stores the email address used when sending quotes
- Allows linking quotes to CRM leads via email matching

### 2. Quote Model Update
**File:** `app/Models/Quote.php`

- Added `customer_email` to the fillable attributes
- This allows the field to be mass-assigned when creating/updating quotes

### 3. Quote Controller Enhancement
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/QuoteController.php`

**Changes to `sendEmail()` method:**
- Added `CrmLead` model import
- Saves the customer email to the quote record
- After successful email send, searches for CRM lead by email
- If a matching lead is found:
  - Updates lead status to `'quote_sent'`
  - Updates `last_contacted_at` timestamp
  - Logs the status change for audit trail
- Returns enhanced success message indicating if CRM lead was updated
- Includes `crm_lead_updated` flag in JSON response for frontend handling

### 4. Frontend Enhancement
**File:** `resources/views/admin/quotes/index.blade.php`

- Updated success notification to display CRM lead update status
- Shows "üéØ CRM lead has been automatically updated!" when applicable
- Uses the backend's `crm_lead_updated` flag to determine messaging

## How It Works

1. User clicks the email button on a quote in the quotes list
2. Email modal opens with customer details pre-filled
3. User enters/confirms customer email address
4. User clicks "Send Email"
5. System:
   - Sends the quote email to the customer
   - Saves the email address to the quote record
   - Updates quote status from 'draft' to 'sent' (if applicable)
   - Searches for CRM lead with matching email
   - If found, updates lead status to 'quote_sent' and timestamp
   - Returns success message with CRM update info
6. Frontend displays success notification with CRM update confirmation

## Benefits

- **Automatic CRM Updates**: No manual status updates needed in CRM
- **Audit Trail**: All changes are logged with timestamps
- **Email Linking**: Quotes are now linked to customer emails for better tracking
- **User Feedback**: Clear messaging when CRM lead is updated
- **Seamless Integration**: Works automatically without disrupting workflow

## CRM Lead Statuses

The system recognizes the following statuses (from `CrmLead` model):
- `new_inquiry`
- `quote_requested`
- `getting_price`
- `price_submitted`
- **`quote_sent`** ‚Üê This is set when quote email is sent
- `follow_up_1`, `follow_up_2`, `follow_up_3`
- `negotiating_price`
- `payment_pending`
- `order_confirmed`
- `deal_lost`
- And others...

## Testing

To test this feature:
1. Create a CRM lead with a specific email address
2. Create a quote for that customer
3. Send the quote via email to the same email address
4. Check that:
   - Email is sent successfully
   - Quote status updates to "sent"
   - CRM lead status updates to "quote_sent"
   - Success message mentions CRM update
   - `last_contacted_at` is updated in CRM lead

## Error Handling

- If email sending fails, no CRM updates occur
- If no matching CRM lead exists, quote still sends successfully
- All errors are logged for troubleshooting
- User receives appropriate error/success messages

## Notes

- Email matching is case-insensitive
- Only the first matching lead by email is updated
- The feature works seamlessly with existing quote workflow
- No changes needed to CRM module - it's automatic!
