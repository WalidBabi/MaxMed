# Email Deliverability Guide - MaxMed Campaign System

## Overview
This guide explains the improvements made to ensure campaign emails go to the inbox instead of the promotions tab in Gmail and other email providers.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Email Headers
The system now includes comprehensive email headers that signal to email providers that these are important business communications, not promotional marketing:

#### Priority Headers
- `X-Priority: 1` (High priority)
- `X-MSMail-Priority: High`
- `Importance: High`
- `X-Importance: High`

#### Business Communication Headers
- `X-Entity-Type: Business`

- `X-Content-Type: business-notification`
- `X-Business-Type: Healthcare-Supplies`

#### Gmail-Specific Headers

- `X-Gmail-Category: Primary`

#### Anti-Spam Headers
- `X-Bulk-Mail: false`
- `X-Marketing-Mail: false`
- `X-Promotional-Mail: false`

### 2. Enhanced Email Content

## Testing Email Deliverability

### Using the Test Command
```bash

# Test with existing campaign
php artisan email:test-deliverability your-email@example.com --campaign-id=1
```

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Send a test email using the command above
2. Check your inbox (not promotions tab)
3. If email is in promotions tab:
   - Move it to inbox
   - Mark as "Not Spam"
   - Add sender to contacts
   - Reply to the email
